# covid19-data

To facilitate research in automatic COVID19 misinformation detection, we introduce the
<b>COVID-Lies</b> dataset for misconception detectionon Twitter. We have collected a dataset of 86 common misconceptions about the disease along with 5K related tweets, identified and annotated by researchers from the UCI School of Medicine. Given an tweet, our data identifies whether any of the
known misconceptions are expressed by the tweet, and if so, whether the tweet propagates the misconception (<i>agree/pos</i>), is informative by contradicting it (<i>disagree/neg</i>), or is neither misinformative nor informative (<i>no stance/na</i>). 

The repository contains the <b>COVID-Lies</b> annotated dataset. To comply with Twitterâ€™s <a href = 'https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy'>Terms of Service </a>, we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use.

This is an evolving dataset as annotation is ongoing.
